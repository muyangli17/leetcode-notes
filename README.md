# leetcode 笔记
leetcode题库中一些个人写的解答。因为主要是出于记录目的而写，所以几乎没有思路分析。
如果日后有空闲了也不是没有可能再回来把思路分析补齐。

但我又岂敢说自己是有资格写leetcode解析的程序员呢？一点小兴趣罢了

会尽量写成一个双语版本。但因为我使用中文和英文时思维风格有显著差异，如出现分歧，在没有额外标注“此处优先参考英语表述”的情节况下请以汉语为准

如有任何建议，请直接用pull request编辑意见簿联系我！

# leetcode-notes
This is the collect of solutions of problems I met in leetcode.
Mainly consist of solutions. Almost no analysis of problems is contained since this notebook is mainly read for myself.

If I will be free in the future, I may return to this repository and add some notes about problem analysis.
But only if I am interested.
ALGORITHM IS FUN!

I will try to write with both Chinese and English.
Due to the different ways of thinking when using different languages, if misunderstanding occurs in my notes, please refer to Chinese first.
Unless a remark 'English first' is given.

For any advices, please contact me directly via editing Comments Book and send me a pull request.
